title: What's Included
---

Every configuration includes a carefully curated set of plugins and rules. No runtime resolution — everything is pre-generated.

## Always Included

These plugins are active in every configuration, regardless of flags:

| Plugin | What It Does |
|--------|--------------|
| **ESLint recommended** | The foundation — core JavaScript rules |
| **TypeScript-ESLint type-checked** | Full type-aware rules using `projectService` |
| **JSDoc** | Documentation quality checks (TypeScript-aware) |
| **RegExp** | Regex best practices and optimization |
| **Vitest + Testing Library** | Test file rules (also works with Bun Test) |
| **Playwright** | E2E test file rules |
| **Prettier compat** | Rules that conflict with Prettier are disabled |

## With `react: true`

| Plugin | What It Does |
|--------|--------------|
| **React recommended** | Core React rules |
| **React Hooks** | All 18 rules from `recommended-latest` |
| **React Compiler** | Future-proof optimization rules |
| **JSX-A11y** | Accessibility rules for JSX elements |
| **Storybook** | Story file linting |

## With `node: true`

| Plugin | What It Does |
|--------|--------------|
| **Node.js ESM** | Proper module resolution and import rules |

## With `ai: true`

| Plugin | What It Does |
|--------|--------------|
| **SonarJS** | Cognitive complexity and code smell detection |
| **TypeScript stylistic** | Consistent TypeScript idioms |
| **simple-import-sort** | Automatic, deterministic import ordering |

See the [AI Mode](/guide/ai-mode) page for the full list of rules and limits.

## Full Type-Checking

Every configuration uses TypeScript's `projectService` for full type information. This means rules like these actually work:

- `@typescript-eslint/no-floating-promises` — Catch unhandled promises
- `@typescript-eslint/await-thenable` — Don't await non-promises
- `@typescript-eslint/no-misused-promises` — Prevent promise misuse in conditions
- `@typescript-eslint/no-unnecessary-type-assertion` — Remove redundant casts

These rules require type information that most ESLint configs skip because it's hard to set up. We handle it for you.
