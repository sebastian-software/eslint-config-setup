# Why This Exists

## The problem

Every TypeScript project needs ESLint. And every team ends up in the same place: 15+ plugins, dozens of config blocks, file-pattern overrides for tests vs. stories vs. e2e, and a config file that nobody fully understands anymore. Someone adds a plugin, it conflicts with an existing rule, three people spend an afternoon debugging why their editor shows different warnings than CI.

Most teams deal with this in one of two ways. They copy-paste configs between repos and watch them drift apart within weeks. Or they use a shared config that's either too loose to catch anything useful or too strict for half their codebase.

And now there's a third pressure: AI writes more and more of your code. Cursor, Copilot, Claude Code — they all produce working code, but without strict lint rules, each tool has its own style. One function uses `any`, the next has magic numbers, a third nests five levels deep. The codebase looks like it was written by a different person every hour. Because it was.

## The solution

This package solves both problems at once. A complete, pre-generated ESLint config that works out of the box — and an AI mode that turns the linter into the single most effective quality gate for generated code.

## How it works

Four boolean flags. Sixteen combinations. All pre-generated at build time.

```
Build Time                          Runtime
─────────                           ───────
ConfigOptions → Bitmask → SHA-1     getEslintConfig(opts) → same hash
                            │                            │
                            ▼                            ▼
                   dist/configs/{hash}.js ◄──── dynamic import
```

When you call `getEslintConfig({ react: true })`, it computes a hash and loads a static JS file. No composition logic runs. No plugins get resolved. The config is just there — a plain array of objects, ready to go.

This means:

- **Instant editor feedback** — no multi-second config build delay
- **Deterministic** — the exact same config loads every time, no plugin-loading-order surprises
- **Inspectable** — open `dist/configs/{hash}.js` to see exactly what's active
- **Snapshot-testable** — rule changes from plugin updates show up as clear diffs
